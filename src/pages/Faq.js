            A. The 2024 Microsoft Office Specialist U.S. National Championship
            presented by Certiport, Inc. is a national competition that tests
            students’ skills in Microsoft Office Word, Excel® and PowerPoint®.
            Top students are invited to represent their respective states at the
            U.S. National Championship in Orlando, Florida on June 17 – 19,
            2024. At the U.S. National Championship Event, each student competes
            to be the champion in their category: Microsoft Word (Office 2019),
            Microsoft Excel (Office 2019), Microsoft PowerPoint (Office 2019),
            Microsoft Word (Microsoft 365 Apps), Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365
            Apps), or Microsoft PowerPoint (Microsoft 365 Apps).

          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. Anyone may participate in the qualification round of testing, but
            to participate in the U.S. National Championship, candidates must be
            students that are enrolled in an approved, degree-seeking academic
            institution recognized by the state in which it operates. Candidates
            must also be between the ages of 13 and 22 (as of June 15 of the
            competition year). Individuals participating in the U.S. National
            Championship must be able to provide proof of age and student status
            upon request. <br />
            Previous participants of the U.S. National Championship round are
            eligible to compete; however, they cannot compete in the exam they
            previously competed in during a U.S. National Championship round.
            For example, a candidate who competed in Microsoft Word (Office
            2016), Microsoft Word (Office 2019) or Microsoft Word (Microsoft 365
            Apps) during a previous U.S. National Championship round can compete
            in Microsoft Excel® or PowerPoint® in the qualifying round and the
            U.S. National Championship Round of this year’s competition.

          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. It’s recommended that candidates regularly check the qualifier
            rankings and retest as needed to secure their seat at the
            competition. There is no limit to the number of times a candidate
            may test in any eligible exam track if they are not in violation of
            the Microsoft Office Specialist exam retake policy. Candidates who
            fail to abide by the Microsoft Office Specialist exam retake policy
            will be immediately disqualified from the Championship. Certiport
            retains the right to disqualify candidates for appropriate cause.

            A. During the qualifying round, a candidate can participate in
            multiple exam tracks. For example, they can submit a Microsoft Excel
            (Office 2019) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft 365 Apps). However, if
            they qualify to participate in the U.S. National Championship, they
            can only compete in only one exam track at the event.

            A. State Champions are announced at the end of the qualification
            periods. The 2024 qualification periods are June 14, 2023 – December
            15, 2023, and December 16, 2023 – May 3, 2024. Shortly after the
            qualifier period ends, state champions and their proctors will be
            notified. All state champions will be invited to the U.S. National
            Championship to compete for the title of the U.S. Champion in
            Microsoft Word (Office 2019), Microsoft Excel® (Office 2019),

            Championship event, all state champions will be tested in a
            proctored lab in their respective exam tracks. All participants in
            the U.S. National Championship are responsible for preparing
            themselves to compete in their respective exams.

            Q. How does Certiport select the winning score?
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. If two competitors at the U.S. National Championship event have
            the same high exam score on the unique comprehensive exams, the
            finalist who completed the exam in the least amount of time will be
            the winner. Decisions of judges are final. Winners will be notified
            during the awards ceremony.

          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. Invitations are usually sent about one to two weeks following the
            last day of the qualification period. Emails will be sent directly
            to the email address listed on the candidate’s Certiport portal
            account.

          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. For each competitor and their one sponsored chaperone, there is
            no registration fee. If competitors choose to bring additional
            guests, there is an additional fee. Competitors are also required to
            cover their own hotel and airfare to arrive at the event. The hotel
            cost is around $165 per night.

          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600 text-justify text-base my-2">
            A. No, competitors will be taking a completely new exam. Like the
            certification exam, this will be project-based. However, since the
            competition tests the most advanced students from around the
            country, candidates are encouraged to study and prepare for topics
            outside the certification exam. A great way to prepare is to take
            the Microsoft Office Specialist Expert exams.
